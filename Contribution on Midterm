I reviewed my two different research papers to help my team get a better background
with DeFi Front-ends. The links to my two papers: 

https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DeFi-Beyond-the-Hype.pdf

and 

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3313991.3314021

I learned very much from these research papers and concluded:

From "Research and Analysis of the Front-End Frameworks and Libraries in E-Business Development", 
I concluded through the research of React.js, Vue.js, and React Native that when 
it comes to E-Businesses, Angular 2 provides the most suitable solution in data
processing combined with one-way and two-way binding. The research also explains how React has high efficiency in rendering updated DOM 
and its powerful technical support and durable API to allow developers to avoid updates and immigration.

From "DeFi Beyond the Hype", I concluded that DeFi is still very immature when it comes to
security. There are a lot of unresolved issues still involved with DeFi and there are 
programmers working all over the world to try to fix these issues. But overall, DeFi 
is the future of technology and there is great potential for DeFi all the way around.

We then used this information to pick three different tools that we started to use 
in order to get an analysis from the different audits and smart contracts.
