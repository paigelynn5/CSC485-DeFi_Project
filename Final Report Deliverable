Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is becoming one of the most popular applications of blockchain technology. 
There is copious amounts of money being invested into the development of DeFi projects. 
This in turn makes DeFi applications a common target of cybersecurity attacks. 
By studying various security analysis tools we can identify different vulnerabilities from DeFi applications. 
The purpose of this project is to analyze multiple applications and observe if there are common vulnerabilities.

Through this project, we utilized three separate smart contract analysis tools, Slither, Mythril, and Mythx, 
to assist with our analysis.

If you enter into enter into Justin, Mark, or Jacob's depository, you will find instructions on how to download the 
tool along with a link to the tool itself. 

Through our research, our group concluded that there are still many projects getting hacked and losing millions of dollars in this DeFi Front-End industry. 
Yet, our analysis showed that these projects have little vulnerabilities in their code. 
So the real question to ask is, how are they getting hacked? 
These attacks are composed of complex attack patterns that require a combination of various attacks and 
practices to abuse these projects. 
One of the main attacks involve flash loans since they are the easiest and cheapest to get away with. 
This attack makes use of various DeFi protocols and happens in mere seconds. 
The current security tools are limited in their ability to determine if, in the future, 
a project will be susceptible to these complex attacks.

Our group overall learned very much from the experienece and are very excited to use the skills that we learned in this
class (CSC-485) out in the real world.
